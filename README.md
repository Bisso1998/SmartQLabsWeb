Q-It App and Q-It Analytics

For all of us, it is tiring and daunting to stand in long queues. So what if we could make queues virtual? The Q-It app servers this purpose. It scans the code of a particular shop and on the correct time 
generates a notification on the phone to ask the customer to be directly present instead of the user 
standing in a queue for long hours. 

Q-It Analytics is a platfrom that enables business person to track and analyze their customer flow. 
Coupled with the Q-It android app, the Q-It analytics platform would give the admin sevral data 
representations like number of customers standing in queue, total number of customer visit to their shop 
bounce rates and other important datas.
